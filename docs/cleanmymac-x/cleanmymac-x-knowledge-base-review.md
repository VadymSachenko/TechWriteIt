This document gives general feedback to the CleanMyMac X knowledge base.

## "Edit this document" button

Documents lacks the "Edit this page" button. Adding this button would allow both internal and external users to contribute to documentation, driving positive impact on the knowlede bas quality.
At my ex company we incorporated this approach. This resulted in incoming multiple internal and external pull requests, which allowed us to reduce stylistic and grammar issues and thus improve quality.

## Copying section links

You can't refer to a specific section within a document, neither by copying the link next to a section, nor by manually adding a section reference tag to a link.

## Link names

Use meaningful link text. If your link refers to a page with the title "MacPaw Account.", don't use such phrases as "this link" or "this page" to refer to the page. Instead, use the title. Instead, give it the name of the page where it leads to.

:::info

Though the absance of spaces is not clearly stated in Apple Style Guide, the examples and use cases provided in it don't have spaces before and after em-dashes.

Also, Google style guide has a clear rules about the usage of em-dashes. Therefore, I used it as additional confirmation. For details, see [Em dashes](https://developers.google.com/style/dashes#em-dashes).

## Style guide linter

If possible, I would recommend using a style guide linters, such as [Vale.sh](https://vale.sh/). Such tools lets you be consistent about following the style guide rules and you don't need to manually check all rules that you may have missed out.
Though, Vale does not offer Apple Style Guide out of the box, meaning you'll need to configure the rules on your own.

## Search

Search is the most important tool in every knowledge base as new users may not be as experineced with the usage of the knowledge base as experience ones or the team the created it.
This mean, each user will likely to use search to find a needed article.

When I, as a user, use the knowledge base search, I struggle to find an article I need. Probably the reason is that it's applied to all MacPaw products at at time, without the division by categories. 
This means users need to use more specific queries, which takes notably more time than expected.

## Structure

The knowledge looks well-structured.
