## Create a localization request

1. In the Tool's admin pane, select **Tools&nbsp<span aria-label="and then">></span> Localization**.
2. On the Localization modules page that opens, go to the **Key** section and click **Create new key**.
3. In the **Key** dialog window that appears, enter the necessary information about the key and click **Send**. This sends the request to Crowdin. When your request gets processed, you receive a notification in the Tool. 

:::note Duplicates are not allowed

You can't send keys that already exist (duplicates) in the system. When you click **Send**, the Tool checks the entered information, and if the key already exists, the "Key already exists" error message is displayed.
