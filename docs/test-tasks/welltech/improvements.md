This document lists points that require clarification with the PM

To have a complete version of the Tool overview document and request localization guide, the following information from PM is required:

## Exchanged data details

The exact nature of the data exchanged between The Tool and Crowdin is not clear. Should the entered key follow a specific format or structure? Should the user use any tags or does the user add the key as raw text? 

## Localization team and user notifications

Details about the notification mechanism from The Tool to the Localization team and the notification to the user are not provided. More information is needed on what information the user and the localization team receive.

## UI elements

Some names of the UI elements the users interact with when requesting localization are missing. In some steps, it's not clear what windows, pages, and buttons users interact with when following the guide. This information is crucial for precise guidance through the process, especially when the guide goes without any visual elements like videos, screenshots, or animations.

## Prerequisite details

If there are any specific permissions that users need to have assigned or preconfiguration that must be done all these points must be mentioned in the Prerequisites section. 

The document does not specify the method of interaction between The Tool and the localization team. Clarification is needed on how the notification to the localization team is achieved.

## Error handling

The error message mentioned is not detailed. The notification to the user in Step 12 is not detailed. More information is needed on what information the user receives.
Also, the Tool may check the text for different criteria, not just for duplicated keys. It means that different types of errors may happenâ€”for example, format inconsistencies, wrong language, or unallowed characters. All these gaps must be covered in the documentation.
