To create a comprehensive Tool overview document and request the localization guide, the following information is necessary:

## Exchanged data details

The exact nature of the data exchanged between The Tool and Crowdin is unclear. Should the entered key follow a specific format or structure? Should the user use any tags, or does the user add the key as raw text? This information can be added to the documentation.

## Localization team and user notifications

Details about the notification mechanism from The Tool to the Localization team and the notification to the user are missing. To enhance the clarity of the process description, provide more detailed information about the content of notifications for both the user and the localization team.

## UI elements

Some names of the UI elements that users interact with when requesting localization are omitted. In certain steps, it's unclear which windows, pages, and buttons users should interact with when following the guide. This information is crucial for precise guidance through the process, especially when the guide lacks visual elements like videos, screenshots, or animations. Additionally, a detailed description of the UI elements must be included in the [Reference information: Request localization](/docs/test-tasks/welltech/request-localization.md#reference-information-request-localization) section, which is currently blank.

## Prerequisite Details

If there are specific permissions that users need to have assigned or additional configurations that must be done, include these details in the [Prerequisites](/docs/test-tasks/welltech/request-localization.md#prerequisites) section.

## Error handling

The error message mentioned is not detailed. The notification to the user lacks specificity. Provide more information about the content of these messages.
Additionally, The Tool may check the text for various criteria, not just for duplicated keys. Thus, different types of errors may occur, such as format inconsistencies, incorrect language, or disallowed characters. Ensure that the provided information covers all possible error scenarios.
