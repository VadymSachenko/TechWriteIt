Hey there. My name is Vadym, and I'm a technical writer.
*TechWriteIt* serves as a knowledgebase for my experiences and knowledge. 
Here, I share everything that can be valuable from a technical writing perspective.
My main purpose in maintaining this website is to have a platform to organize my work and to share my insights with fellow technical writers.

If you are a talent acquisition specialist and are interested in offering a job opportunity or learning more about my expertise, please take a look at my [Work Experience](/blog/) section.
