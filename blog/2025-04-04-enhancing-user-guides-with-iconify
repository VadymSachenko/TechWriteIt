When I first started incorporating icons into my user guides, I quickly realized the challenges of managing them as static images. The process was cumbersome and time-consuming, especially when maintaining consistency. I began searching for a more efficient solution that required minimal manual intervention. When I came across Iconify, the initial installation wasn't straightforward—it didn't work out of the box for my project. After some experimentation and discussions with GPT, I successfully integrated Iconify. My first use of Iconify was within our internal documentation portal, followed by this very blog. Having struggled initially, my second attempt at integration was effortless, as I knew exactly what steps to follow. In this article, I'll share my experience and provide a practical guide on how to install Iconify in your Docusaurus project.

## Why and when icons can be helpful

Icons aren't merely decorative—they actively enhance comprehension and usability. Here’s why they matter:

- **In user guides:** When technical writers create user guides, it's common that buttons, navigation menus, and other UI elements contain icons within their names. Including the same icons directly in the user guides significantly improves user-friendliness, making it easier to identify UI components quickly. This approach aligns perfectly if your documentation policy aims at minimizing screenshots, by offering clearer visual user guide steps.
- **On social media:** You can use Iconify to seamlessly integrate recognizable social media icons into your documentation portals or blogs. Iconify icons are easily customizable in terms of design, color, and size, which ensures consistency across your content. Also, you can assign a link to them same way as you do with markdown text.

## It's hard to use icons if you use them as images

When I initially started using icons, I embedded them as static image files. However, this method had clear limitations:

- **Scalability issues:** Icons would become pixelated or distorted on high-resolution displays, negatively affecting visual quality.
- **Styling limitations:** Adjusting icon colors or sizes required editing each image individually, a highly time-consuming task.
- **Performance concerns:** Embedding multiple image files increased load times and impacted overall page performance.

Iconify addresses these issues effectively. It offers access to an extensive library of over 200,000 icons from various open-source icon sets. Icons are served as SVGs; thus, they remain scalable at any resolution. Additionally, icons can be easily styled using CSS, greatly simplifying maintenance and customization.

## Use cases

To illustrate the practical benefits of Iconify, let’s compare user guide instructions without and with icons:

**Without icons:**

1. Go to the settings page.
2. Click on the "Save" button to apply changes.

**With icons:**

1. Go to the settings page. <Icon icon="mdi:cog" height="24" style={{ color: '#009b72' }} />
2. Click on the "Save" button to apply changes. <Icon icon="mdi:content-save" height="24" style={{ color: '#009b72' }} />

Clearly, using icons helps users follow instructions intuitively and efficiently.

## How to start using Iconify

Iconify is beneficial for anyone creating digital content, including websites, documentation sites, applications, or design mockups.

- For general integration steps, please refer to the official [Iconify documentation](https://iconify.design/docs/).

- If you're specifically working with Docusaurus, I have prepared an easy-to-follow guide based on my experience. Check it out here: [Integrate Iconify](/docs/docusaurus/features/integrate-iconify.md).

Incorporating Iconify into your user guides enhances usability and provides clear, visual guidance. Give it a try—I believe you'll appreciate the difference.
